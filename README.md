# ðŸ“± Appium Android Gesture Automation Project

This is my first mobile automation project using **Appium** and **Java**, built to practice and demonstrate various user gesture interactions on the **API Demos Android App**.

## âœ… What I Did

I created a set of test cases to automate real user gestures using **UIAutomator2** on a virtual Android device. The main focus of the project is to simulate and validate different types of mobile gestures.

### âœ¨ Implemented Gestures:
- âœ… **Long Press** â€“ Simulates holding an element to trigger a context menu.
- âœ… **Drag and Drop** â€“ Drags one element to another target location and drops it.
- âœ… **Swipe Gesture** â€“ Swipes through content horizontally or vertically.
- âœ… **Press Activity** â€“ Navigates to an activity by simulating a deep press.
- âœ… **Device Rotation** â€“ Rotates the screen orientation (portrait â†” landscape).

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
- Appium
- Java
- TestNG
- UIAutomator2
- Android Emulator

## ðŸ“‚ App Under Test:
- **App Name**: API Demos
- **Package**: `io.appium.android.apis`
- **Activity**: `io.appium.android.apis.ApiDemos`

## ðŸš€ Purpose
This project was built as part of my learning journey in mobile automation. It helped me understand how to interact with Android elements using gestures, execute test cases using TestNG, and work with Appium server and emulator integration.
